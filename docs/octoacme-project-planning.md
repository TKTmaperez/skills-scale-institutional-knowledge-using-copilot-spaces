# OctoAcme â€” Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives

- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)

6. Create release plan and milestone map

For detailed role-specific responsibilities during planning, see the [Cross-Functional Collaboration Checklist](octoacme-collaboration-checklist.md).
